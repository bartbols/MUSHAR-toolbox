## MUSHAR: A MATLAB toolbox for three-dimensional reconstruction and analysis of muscle shape and architecture.

## Features
1. Establish point-to-point correspondence on surface and inside volumes through non-rigid registration of distance maps.
1. Reconstruction of group-averaged muscle shape and muscle architecture.
    1. Includes code for averaging and interpolating diffusion tensors in the [log-Euclidean domain](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.20965)
1. Statistical analysis of local changes in shape and architecture (pennation angles).

## Installation
The following software tools should be installed and made available on the command line:
* Matlab (developed and tested in version R2019b)
* [Shapeworks](http://sciinstitute.github.io/ShapeWorks/)
* [Elastix](https://elastix.lumc.nl/) (developed and tested on version 4.7)
